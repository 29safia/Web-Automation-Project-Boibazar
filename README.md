Web_Automation_Using_Selenium

I'm thrilled to present my most recent browser testing automation script! This project shows how to use Selenium WebDriver in Java to run a browser, check page titles, and more.

## Selenium_Basics
Selenium is an effective tool for programmatically managing web browsers.Its scripts are written in a variety of languages including Python, Java, C#, and others, and it functions in all browsers and on all major operating systems.Java will be used in our work.

## Java Basics for Automation Testers
In order to prepare for working with **Selenium** for web automation, **automation testers** who wish to develop a solid foundation in **Java** should use this repository. This collection covers fundamental Java principles designed with automation testers in mind, regardless of your level of experience.
Many automation frameworks, including Selenium, are built on the foundation of Java. Writing test scripts that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable requires a solid knowledge of Java basics. The gap between learning Java and using it in practical test automation scenarios is filled by this repository.
