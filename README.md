## Java Basics for Automation Testers
In order to prepare for working with **Selenium** for web automation, **automation testers** who wish to develop a solid foundation in **Java** should use this repository. This collection covers fundamental Java principles designed with automation testers in mind, regardless of your level of experience.
Many automation frameworks, including Selenium, are built on the foundation of Java. Writing test scripts that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable requires a solid knowledge of Java basics. The gap between learning Java and using it in practical test automation scenarios is filled by this repository.
