Java is an object-oriented, multipurpose programming language that is platform-neutral. Regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system, Java programs can execute on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is a tried-and-true method for developing and testing applications. 

# Java Basics for Automation Testers
In order to prepare for working with **Selenium** for web automation, **automation testers** who wish to develop a solid foundation in **Java** should use this repository. This collection covers fundamental Java principles designed with automation testers in mind, regardless of your level of experience.
